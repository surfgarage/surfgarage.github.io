Do you often drag your board all the way from the top floor of your building and bump it everywhere on your way down. Leave your board with us in a safe/secure place. You only have to care about catching waves, while your board is waiting for you 3 minutes from surf. Lock your phone and wallet in the lockers. Take a nice shower after surf and leave your wetsuit to dry at Surf Garage.",
